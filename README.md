# SupervisedMachineLearningForChromosomalAberrations

This is a compendium of my best work for NASA. All these 
projects evolved on the span of at least 2 decades. Out of
a huge heap of publications and code developed on the subject
of space radiation and its effect on human health, I included 
herein my work closer to AI/ML/DS areas, in which area I 
continue my career now. 

For those who like to ask about my background (perhaps, 
recruiters and employers), the flowchart of my career is as 
follows:
general high aptitude in science and math in high school ->
olympiads in math and physics ->
boarding school for gifted children in math and physics ->
undergraduate studies in a physics department in 2 places ->
a student in a theoretical physics group led by a Nobel Prize
winner, Vitaly L. Ginzburg ->
Ph.D. in applied physics from Columbia University ->
internship in Los Alamos National Lab ->
post-doc at math department at UC Berkeley ->
post-doc at NASA JSC ->
assistant professor at BCM, Houston ->
senior research scientist at NASA JSC ->
senior data scientist at FORA capital ->
doing projects from home during COVID-19 pandemic ->
next stage? I am interested in going deeper into ML/DS/AI,
especially NLP algorithms; I want to work at a company
where I can apply my best skills...

So, my work at NASA JSC, that goes into this repo, has the 
following flowchart:
particle physics of relativistic ions in space and radiation 
transport through matter ->
human DNA damage and breakage patterns from space particles ->
superposition of radiation tracks and coiled chromatin
translates into a unique high-energy DNA breakage pattern ->
DNA breakage leads to chomosome aberrations with complex
aberrations being the signature of space particles ->
due to combinatorial complexity of chromosome aberratation,
a supervised training algorithm in employed to match 
the algorithmic classification of aberrations to a given
classification scheme employed by a particular lab (or labs) ->
the frequency and type of aberrations has different sensitivity
to different energies, which suggest a new strategy for
spacecraft radiation shielding -- only the part of particle
spectrum where DNA is most sensitive needs to be suppressed ->
particle spectrum can be manipulated by different materials
with low atomic numbers and high atomic numbers ->
a compound radiation shield is proposed with hydrogen, 
water, alumunum and hafnium ->
hafnium has additional pathways of energy absorption --
high neutron absortion ability and, possibly, the isomer spin
resonance ->
the overall optimization demands a "super" machine learning
approach -- with a multi-parametric feature space ->
the proposed feature space has the following categorical
and numeric axes:
target -- human or electroncis;
mission stages (LEO, GEO, Lagrange points, deep space, 
planetory surfaces with and w/o atmospheres, access to
in situ materials);
habitality considerations -- astronaut life regimen and 
intra-habitat radiation environment;
antioxydant diets and human body "radiation hardening" with
antioxydant drugs ->
real-time interation between the developed AI system and the
flight surgeon during the mission ->
in-flight and on-board mitigation...
TBD.
